title: Forging the Right Attitude
---

I am a bladesmith in my spare time. I started by going to a hammer-in at Coopers Forge in San Antonio where I made my first knife by learning from several individuals who had competed on the History Channel's TV show Forged in Fire over the course
of two days. I received about two-hours of hands on experience at the end where I forged the blade. It took several more weeks to finish it. The knife was terrible, as depicted below. There is no plunge line. There is no bevel. There are visible gaps. It's 
too thick. It was not heat treated properly. That being said, I love that knife. It is the first one I made. It is functional. It is tangible. It shows what I could make at the time.

When I finished it, I showed it to one of the bladesmiths that helped me over Instagram. His response was "We all start somewhere". A little curt, but he said a lot in the statement. It made me realize 
while it was a great personal achievement, there was a lot to learn still.

As I've met other bladesmiths, and learned from them, what has stuck with me most is their attitude. They are all happy to show their work, and talk about how they made it. Each one does things slightly differently, and focuses on 
what is important to them.

Do I make my knives the exact same way that they do? No. Some have and use a power hammer. Some buy a commercially made forge, others build their own. Some build their own hammers and tongs. Some buy anvils, others use ASOs (Anvil Shaped Objects). They
vary in hammering techniques. They vary in preference for steel to use, and the grinder they prefer. Despite the difference in setup, and technique, they are able to create works of art.

How does this relate to software development?

The next time you review someone else's code, and you start to see red because it is not how you would have done it, take a deep breath and ask yourself these questions:
1. Is the code functional? *Does it pass the tests?
2. Was there a critical failure during testing (or production)? *Think of the grain structure of a knife. If the grains are too large, the blade can break. This is not a question of fit and polish. During rigorous testing of a knife minor damage may occur to the blade.
3. How is the fit and polish? *Are there any noticeable gaps, or blemishes? Are there any spelling errors? I.e. Does it meet the teams code standards?
4. Does it meet the client's expectations? *Did I make a knife that will fulfill the client's needs?

As responses are formulated to these questions assume the person did their best, and offer constructive advice on how to improve the product.
